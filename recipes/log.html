        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you haven't tried this Yule log
            recipe because you thought it required 
            advanced baking and pastry skill,
            then get ready to buche up this Noel,
            since the techniques required are actually
            quite simple. This classic holiday dessert
            is a showstopper, but it's ofter better looking
            than it is tasting, which is not the 
            case here, thanks to a simple-to-make, rich 
            chocolate sponge cake, and mocha
            buttercream filling. Garnished here
            with meringue mushrooms and rosemary.

            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the buttercream filling:
                    Whip powdered sugar, butter, coffee flavored liqueur,
                    cocoa powder,and salt together in the bowl of a stand
                    mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on high speed.
                </li>
                <li>Transfer filling mixture to a 
                    separate bowl and add mascarpone 
                    cheese. Mix until combined; set
                    aside. Clean and dry the stand 
                    mixer bowl.
                </li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F 
                    (200 degrees C).
                </li>
                <li>Prepare a 13x8 inch rimmed sheet pan for the sponge cake:
                    Brush a little melted butter over the sheet pan,
                    then line the pan with parchment paper, and
                    brush remaining melted butter on top.
                </li>
                <li>Whisk cocoa powder, flour, and salt 
                    together in a bowl, making sure to break
                    up any clumps.
                </li>
                <li>Place eggs in the clean blown of
                    your stand mixer. Add sugar and whip
                    the whisk attachment until fluffy,
                    thick, and very light in color, 2 to
                    3 minutes. Add vanilla and 1/2 of the
                    cocoa powder mixture; mix on low speed 
                    for a few seconds. Add the remaining cocoa
                    mixture and mix on low for a few seconds.
                    Switch to high speed and mix until the mixture is
                    moistened but not fully blended. Pull off the whisk
                    attachment and use it to whisk the batter by hand
                    until evenly blended. 
                </li>
                <li>Pour batter onto the prepared
                    sheet pan and spread out with a 
                    spatula, almost to the edges, but not
                    quite. Tap the pan on the counter several 
                    times to remove any large air bubbles.
                </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the 
                    top is dry and the edges start to pull 
                    away from the sides, 8 to 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>While the cake is baking, sift powdered
                    sugar onto a clean kitchen towel to 
                    cover an area slightly larger than 
                    the sponge cake.
                </li>
                <li>Remove the cake from the oven. Run a 
                    knife around the edges of the pan. Dust 
                    some powdered sugar over the top. Run a 
                    spatula under the parchment paper to make sure 
                    it's not stuck to the pan.
                </li>
                <li>Quickly flip the pan on top of the 
                    sugared area on the towel to invert 
                    the cake. Carefully remove the parchment 
                    paper, then sift more powdered sugar 
                    over the cake. Gently roll the cake 
                    up inside the towel; allow to cool for 
                    15 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Carefully unroll the cooled cake. Dollop 
                    as much buttercream filling as you like 
                    on top, reserving some for later; spread 
                    to the edges. Roll cake up over the filling, 
                    using the towel to lift it if needed. 
                    Sprinkle more powdered sugar on top 
                    over the log, then wrap in plastic wrap. 
                    Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.
                </li>
                <li>Make the ganache frosting: Pour hot cream 
                    over choclate chips in a bowl. Let sit for
                    1 minute, then whisk until chocolate is melted.
                </li>
                <li>Make an angled cut 3 inches from ove end of 
                    the log. Place log on a parchment lined sheet 
                    pan. Apple some filling to the angled slice 
                    and attach it to one side of the log. Spread 
                    a layer of ganache all over the cake, except 
                    for the swirls on the ends. Refrigerate for 
                    15 minutes to firm up the ganache.
                </li>
                <li>Use the tip of a knife to carve lines 
                    into the ganache to create the appearance 
                    of tree bark. Refrigerate until 
                    completely chilled.
                </li>
                <li>Dust with cocoa powder and powdered 
                    sugar before serving.
                </li>

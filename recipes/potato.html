        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must have at Hanukkah, but are really wonderful any time of the year!
            This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly
            the best potato latke I've ever had. I usually end up
            making a second batch because they disappear so quickly.
            I've tried other recipes and always return to
            this one. Lovely topped with sour cream or
            apple sauce.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
            <li>Fourth cup of grated onion</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
            <li>Half a teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
       <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix potto, onion, eggs, crushed crackers, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first
                pressing potato mixture against the side of the bowl to remove excess liquid,
                into the hot oil; slightly flatted the latkes
                into the oil with the back of your spoon so they
                are an even thickness.</li>
            <li>Cook in batches in the hot oil until
                browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
                Drain latkes on a paper towel-line plate.</li>
        </ol>
